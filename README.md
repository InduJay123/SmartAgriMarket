🌾 <strong>Final Year Project Guide</strong></br>
  <strong> “Smart Agricultural Market Management System for Sri Lankan Farmers” </strong>
  (Case Study: Dambulla Economic Centre)

🧩 <strong> 1. Problem Background </strong>

  🇱🇰 The Situation in Sri Lanka
  Farmers bring vegetables and fruits to economic centres like Dambulla, but prices change daily based on supply and demand.</br>
  There’s no digital system for farmers to predict prices, plan harvests, or directly connect with buyers.</br>
  Middlemen often control pricing → farmers get unfair value for their produce.</br>
  Wastage occurs due to poor coordination — produce rots before sale.</br>

🎯  <strong>2. Project Goal </strong></br>

To design and develop a web-based Agricultural Market Management System that:</br>
Digitizes the connection between farmers, buyers, and market officials.</br>
Provides real-time price information and forecasting.</br>
Helps reduce post-harvest losses and improves income predictability.</br>

🧠  <strong>3. System Overview </strong>
👨‍🌾 Stakeholders:</br>

Farmers – Register, publish expected harvests, view market price trends.</br>
Buyers / Wholesalers – View available produce, place pre-orders, negotiate prices.</br>
Market Admin / Officials – Monitor stock, verify farmers, manage prices and data.</br>
